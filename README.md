# Iprice Coding Assessment

## Assignment brief:
As I understand the task; I am to create a simple script that can read and count the frequencies of each word that appears in a list or corpus.

As I was travelling whilst I first got the assignment I decided to create a very simple script. You can access that script using (SimpleScript.py). Although this script was pretty good at handling small and better structured documents it couldn't really handle bigger and more random corpuses. So I decided to use the NLTK library to create something more substantial. That can be accessed using (FinalWordCounter.ipynb). I choose to use Juypter notebooks for the final word counter because it would improve readability and help me explain thought process better.

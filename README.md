# IpriceAssessment

## Assignment brief:
As I understand the task; I am to create a simle script that can read and count the frequencies of each word that appears in a list or corpus.

As I was travelling whilst I first got the assignment I decided to create a very simple script. You can access that script using (SimpleScript.py). Although this script was pretty good at handling small and better structured documents it counldn't really handle bigger and more random corpuses. So I decided to use the NLTK library to create something more substancial. That can be accesssed using (FinalWordCounter.py).
